# 3D Progrming Project

## This 3D Programming Project is a Rasterizer demo that focuses on exploring various 3D techniques to a certain degree.

The following techniques are currently explored: 
- Deferred Rendering: A technique for rendering complex scenes more efficiently by separating the rendering of geometry and lighting into different passes.

- Shadow Mapping: A technique used to add realistic shadows to 3D scenes by simulating how light interacts with objects.

- OBJ Parser: An Basic implementation to read and load 3D models in the .obj file format
- Dynamic Cubic Environment Mapping: A technique for simulating reflective surfaces by using a cube map that represents the environment around the object.

- Frustum Culling using an Octree: A technique to optimize rendering performance by excluding objects that are outside the camera's view frustum, using an octree.

- GPU-based Billboarded Particle System: A particle system where particles always face the camera, using GPU to handle calculations and rendering efficiently.

- Level of Detail (LOD) using Tessellation: A technique for dynamically adjusting the complexity of objects based on their distance from the camera, using tessellation to add more detail as objects get closer.
